# How to contribute to tf.libsonnet

**Filing issues**

- **Report bugs and feature requests on the libgenerator repository as GitHub issues**. This is an autogenerated
  library, which means that any bugs and feature requests need to be reported on the [libgenerator
  project](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/libgenerator) which is responsible for generating this repository. If you
  found an issue, you can open a new issue from [this
  link](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/libgenerator/issues/new/choose).
- **Do not open a GitHub issue if you are reporting a security vulnerability with the tf.libsonnet project**. Instead,
  refer to our [security policy](/SECURITY.md).


**Contributing a change**

- **This is an autogenerated library**. This means that all contributions will not be merged until the changes can be
  autogenerated from the generator. You may still open a Pull Request with a suggested change, especially if it helps
  augment an issue description by providing an example of what should be generated.
- **All commits must be signed off to adhere to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**. If you are contributing a
  change to `libgenerator`, note that the `tf.libsonnet` org requires all contributors to sign off on [the
  DCO](https://developercertificate.org/). You can do this with the `-s` flag when making commits with `git commit`.
    - If you forgot to sign off on any commits in a Pull Request, you can amend the offending commit with `git commit -s
      --amend`.
- **All commits must be signed**. The `tf.libsonnet` org requires all contributors to [sign their
  commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits). If you do
  not wish to maintain a set of private keys on your account, you can also use the
  [sigstore/gitsign](https://github.com/sigstore/gitsign) project for keyless signing with your GitHub account.
