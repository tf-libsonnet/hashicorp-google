  '#new':: d.fn(help="\n`google.game_services_game_server_deployment.new` injects a new `google_game_services_game_server_deployment` Terraform `resource`\nblock into the root module document.\n\nAdditionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the\nresource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:\n\n    # arguments omitted for brevity\n    google.game_services_game_server_deployment.new('some_id')\n\nYou can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `google.game_services_game_server_deployment` using the reference:\n\n    $._ref.google_game_services_game_server_deployment.some_id.get('id')\n\nThis is the same as directly entering `\"${ google_game_services_game_server_deployment.some_id.id }\"` as the value.\n\nNOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,\nor `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.\n\n**Args**:\n  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.\n  - `deployment_id` (`string`): A unique id for the deployment.\n  - `description` (`string`): Human readable description of the game server deployment. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.\n  - `labels` (`obj`): The labels associated with this game server deployment. Each label is a\nkey-value pair. When `null`, the `labels` field will be omitted from the resulting object.\n  - `location` (`string`): Location of the Deployment. When `null`, the `location` field will be omitted from the resulting object.\n  - `project` (`string`):  When `null`, the `project` field will be omitted from the resulting object.\n  - `timeouts` (`obj`):  When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google.game_services_game_server_deployment.timeouts.new](#fn-gameservicesgameserverdeploymenttimeoutsnew) constructor.\n\n**Returns**:\n- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.\n", args=[]),
