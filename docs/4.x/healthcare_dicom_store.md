## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`google.healthcare_dicom_store.new` injects a new `google_healthcare_dicom_store` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    google.healthcare_dicom_store.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `google.healthcare_dicom_store` using the reference:

    $._ref.google_healthcare_dicom_store.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ google_healthcare_dicom_store.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `dataset` (`string`): Identifies the dataset addressed by this request. Must be in the format
&#39;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset}&#39;
  - `labels` (`obj`): User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize DICOM stores.

Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must
conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}][\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,62}

Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128
bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63}

No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.

An object containing a list of &#34;key&#34;: value pairs.
Example: { &#34;name&#34;: &#34;wrench&#34;, &#34;mass&#34;: &#34;1.3kg&#34;, &#34;count&#34;: &#34;3&#34; }. When `null`, the `labels` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name` (`string`): The resource name for the DicomStore.

** Changing this property may recreate the Dicom store (removing all data) **
  - `notification_config` (`list[obj]`): A nested object resource When `null`, the `notification_config` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google.healthcare_dicom_store.notification_config.new](#fn-healthcare_dicom_storenotification_confignew) constructor.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`):  When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google.healthcare_dicom_store.timeouts.new](#fn-healthcare_dicom_storetimeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`google.healthcare_dicom_store.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `healthcare_dicom_store`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [google.healthcare_dicom_store.new](#fn-healthcare_dicom_storenew), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.

**Args**:
  - `dataset` (`string`): Identifies the dataset addressed by this request. Must be in the format
&#39;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset}&#39;
  - `labels` (`obj`): User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize DICOM stores.

Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must
conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}][\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,62}

Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128
bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63}

No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.

An object containing a list of &#34;key&#34;: value pairs.
Example: { &#34;name&#34;: &#34;wrench&#34;, &#34;mass&#34;: &#34;1.3kg&#34;, &#34;count&#34;: &#34;3&#34; }. When `null`, the `labels` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name` (`string`): The resource name for the DicomStore.

** Changing this property may recreate the Dicom store (removing all data) **
  - `notification_config` (`list[obj]`): A nested object resource When `null`, the `notification_config` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google.healthcare_dicom_store.notification_config.new](#fn-healthcare_dicom_storenotification_confignew) constructor.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`):  When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google.healthcare_dicom_store.timeouts.new](#fn-healthcare_dicom_storetimeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
  - An attribute object that can be used with [tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) to construct a new `healthcare_dicom_store` resource into the root Terraform configuration.
