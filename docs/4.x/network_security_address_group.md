## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`google.network_security_address_group.new` injects a new `google_network_security_address_group` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    google.network_security_address_group.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `google.network_security_address_group` using the reference:

    $._ref.google_network_security_address_group.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ google_network_security_address_group.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `capacity` (`number`): Capacity of the Address Group.
  - `description` (`string`): Free-text description of the resource. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `items` (`list`): List of items. When `null`, the `items` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `labels` (`obj`): Set of label tags associated with the AddressGroup resource.
An object containing a list of &#34;key&#34;: value pairs. Example: { &#34;name&#34;: &#34;wrench&#34;, &#34;mass&#34;: &#34;1.3kg&#34;, &#34;count&#34;: &#34;3&#34; }. When `null`, the `labels` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `location` (`string`): The location of the gateway security policy.
The default value is &#39;global&#39;.
  - `name` (`string`): Name of the AddressGroup resource.
  - `parent` (`string`): The name of the parent this address group belongs to. Format: organizations/{organization_id} or projects/{project_id}. When `null`, the `parent` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `type` (`string`): The type of the Address Group. Possible values are &#34;IPV4&#34; or &#34;IPV6&#34;. Possible values: [&#34;IPV4&#34;, &#34;IPV6&#34;]
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google.network_security_address_group.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`google.network_security_address_group.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `network_security_address_group`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [google.network_security_address_group.new](#fn-new), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.

**Args**:
  - `capacity` (`number`): Capacity of the Address Group.
  - `description` (`string`): Free-text description of the resource. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `items` (`list`): List of items. When `null`, the `items` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `labels` (`obj`): Set of label tags associated with the AddressGroup resource.
An object containing a list of &#34;key&#34;: value pairs. Example: { &#34;name&#34;: &#34;wrench&#34;, &#34;mass&#34;: &#34;1.3kg&#34;, &#34;count&#34;: &#34;3&#34; }. When `null`, the `labels` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `location` (`string`): The location of the gateway security policy.
The default value is &#39;global&#39;.
  - `name` (`string`): Name of the AddressGroup resource.
  - `parent` (`string`): The name of the parent this address group belongs to. Format: organizations/{organization_id} or projects/{project_id}. When `null`, the `parent` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `type` (`string`): The type of the Address Group. Possible values are &#34;IPV4&#34; or &#34;IPV6&#34;. Possible values: [&#34;IPV4&#34;, &#34;IPV6&#34;]
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google.network_security_address_group.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
  - An attribute object that can be used with [tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) to construct a new `network_security_address_group` resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn withCapacity

```ts
withCapacity()

`google.number.withCapacity` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `number`
Terraform resource block to set or update the capacity field.



**Args**:

  - `value` (`number`): The value to set for the `capacity` field.


### fn withDescription

```ts
