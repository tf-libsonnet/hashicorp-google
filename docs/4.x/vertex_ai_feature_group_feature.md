## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`google.vertex_ai_feature_group_feature.new` injects a new `google_vertex_ai_feature_group_feature` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    google.vertex_ai_feature_group_feature.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `google.vertex_ai_feature_group_feature` using the reference:

    $._ref.google_vertex_ai_feature_group_feature.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ google_vertex_ai_feature_group_feature.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `description` (`string`): The description of the FeatureGroup. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `feature_group` (`string`): The name of the Feature Group.
  - `labels` (`obj`): The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your FeatureGroup.

**Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
Please refer to the field &#39;effective_labels&#39; for all of the labels present on the resource. When `null`, the `labels` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name` (`string`): The resource name of the Feature Group Feature.
  - `project` (`string`): Set the `project` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `project` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `region` (`string`): The region for the resource. It should be the same as the feature group&#39;s region.
  - `version_column_name` (`string`): The name of the BigQuery Table/View column hosting data for this version. If no value is provided, will use featureId. When `null`, the `version_column_name` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google.vertex_ai_feature_group_feature.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`google.vertex_ai_feature_group_feature.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `vertex_ai_feature_group_feature`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [google.vertex_ai_feature_group_feature.new](#fn-new), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.

**Args**:
  - `description` (`string`): The description of the FeatureGroup. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `feature_group` (`string`): The name of the Feature Group.
  - `labels` (`obj`): The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your FeatureGroup.

**Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
Please refer to the field &#39;effective_labels&#39; for all of the labels present on the resource. When `null`, the `labels` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name` (`string`): The resource name of the Feature Group Feature.
  - `project` (`string`): Set the `project` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `project` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `region` (`string`): The region for the resource. It should be the same as the feature group&#39;s region.
  - `version_column_name` (`string`): The name of the BigQuery Table/View column hosting data for this version. If no value is provided, will use featureId. When `null`, the `version_column_name` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google.vertex_ai_feature_group_feature.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
  - An attribute object that can be used with [tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) to construct a new `vertex_ai_feature_group_feature` resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn withDescription

```ts
withDescription()
```

`google.string.withDescription` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the description field.



**Args**:

  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `description` field.


### fn withFeatureGroup
