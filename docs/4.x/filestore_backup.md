## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`google.filestore_backup.new` injects a new `google_filestore_backup` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    google.filestore_backup.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `google.filestore_backup` using the reference:

    $._ref.google_filestore_backup.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ google_filestore_backup.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `description` (`string`): A description of the backup with 2048 characters or less. Requests with longer descriptions will be rejected. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `labels` (`obj`): Resource labels to represent user-provided metadata. When `null`, the `labels` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `location` (`string`): The name of the location of the instance. This can be a region for ENTERPRISE tier instances.
  - `name` (`string`): The resource name of the backup. The name must be unique within the specified instance.

The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
the regular expression &#39;[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?&#39; which means the
first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
character, which cannot be a dash.
  - `project` (`string`): Set the `project` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `project` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `source_file_share` (`string`): Name of the file share in the source Cloud Filestore instance that the backup is created from.
  - `source_instance` (`string`): The resource name of the source Cloud Filestore instance, in the format projects/{projectId}/locations/{locationId}/instances/{instanceId}, used to create this backup.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google.filestore_backup.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`google.filestore_backup.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `filestore_backup`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [google.filestore_backup.new](#fn-new), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.

**Args**:
  - `description` (`string`): A description of the backup with 2048 characters or less. Requests with longer descriptions will be rejected. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `labels` (`obj`): Resource labels to represent user-provided metadata. When `null`, the `labels` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `location` (`string`): The name of the location of the instance. This can be a region for ENTERPRISE tier instances.
  - `name` (`string`): The resource name of the backup. The name must be unique within the specified instance.

The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
the regular expression &#39;[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?&#39; which means the
first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
character, which cannot be a dash.
  - `project` (`string`): Set the `project` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `project` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `source_file_share` (`string`): Name of the file share in the source Cloud Filestore instance that the backup is created from.
  - `source_instance` (`string`): The resource name of the source Cloud Filestore instance, in the format projects/{projectId}/locations/{locationId}/instances/{instanceId}, used to create this backup.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google.filestore_backup.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
  - An attribute object that can be used with [tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) to construct a new `filestore_backup` resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn withDescription

```ts
withDescription()
```

`google.string.withDescription` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the description field.

  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `description` field.


### fn withLabels

```ts
withLabels()
```

`google.obj.withLabels` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `obj`
Terraform resource block to set or update the labels field.
